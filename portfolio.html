            <p>
              During the first semester of Multimedia Design at Copenhagen
              School of Design and Technology have I been introduced to the
              basics behind front-end development and content creation. The main
              focus has been on developing the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and
              very basic vanilla JavaScript. Apart from that, have we also been
              taught various design conventions and ways to develop your own
              creations, such as working with crazy 8's, trunk test and a
              variety of different design sprint methods.
            </p>

              This website is a part of my final examination in the first
              semester, but it's also a way to showcase my growth and
              skill-development throughout these couple of months.

            <h2>Basic web</h2>
            <p>
              We were introducted during this module to the absolute basics
              of website-development. We got familiar with terminologies and how
              to set up the essential softwares on the computer, such as VScode
              and FileZilla to be able to upload files onto our servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main assignment of this module was to develop a basic,
              responsive website. Most of the text, images and layout-plans were
              already handed down to us from our teachers. Our job was to figure
              out how to create a functional website, includnig all of the
              assigned content, in the way that the layout plan had called for.

            <h2>Basic UX/UI</h2>
            <p>
              This was a really fun assignment, where we were introduced to various design conventions, how to brainstorm a design-idea such as using
              Crazy 8's, analyse user-stories, to how to put together a functional prototype in Figma. In the end we had to create and code the website based of the prototype. It truly felt like a great fun
              exercise where you got to work with a project from start to
              finish.

            <p>This module provided the foundational principles of how I have approached the following projects. </p>

              JavaScript was
              introduced to us, and the main project of this module was to
              develop a simple game in a website, learning how to communicate between HTML, CSS and JS. It was incredibly challenging at first, because it was the first time I delved into learning a programming language.
            </p>
            <p>
              In doing this project, we had to illustrate assets based on a
              specific style. I chose to analyse the style used in the game
              <em>Two dots</em>, illustrated by the British illustrator Owen
              Davey. The illustrations were created using Illustrator, and later exported as SVG.
            </p>
            <p>The sound-effects were also made by me, using Audition to distort the sounds, and the game-music was made by putting loops together in garageBand, making sure the scales were watching what was showing on the screen, think of game-over vs. level-complete.</p>
            <p>We were also introduced to CSS animations and positions, and if you are reading this on my website now I guess you can tell I have incoperated quite a bit of animations and interactions in my design. </p>

              The last module before the exam was divided into two major parts.
              The first part introduced us to video-recording as a team and doing solo-editing in Premiere Pro. The second and much bigger part involed us as a team of five to take contact with a small business who had an out-dated/non-functional website. With this buisness would we work together in creating a new prototype, record and create a brand-related video, and coding the website.

I also got to create a website, centering around her. I tried to keep to the same colour-palette and aesthetic as she carried with her. </p></div>

            <p>In the last and biggest project of this semester we worked together with a company namned <em>Tak for Kaffe</em>, where we were going to redesign their website and create a video for them using professional equipment and softwares. For the recording we used my Sony Mirrorless DSLR, and Røde microphone borrowed from Tech Lab at the school.</p>
            <p>The redesign of the website was made by using a collaborate Figma-file that I hosted. We started with pointing out what felt typical for this company, then branched out to creating moodboards and potential stylesheets. Later one we got some feedback from the owner of the shop and we created prototype for the redesign of the website.</p>
            <p>My initial role in this group assignment however was to be the GitHub master and making sure that the coding got done. I assisted my groupmates whenever needed, but I wasn't allowed to make any changes in their pages. What I was responsible in coding  was the index-page, and creating a global navigation and footer, so that it would look the same across the website. </p>
            <p>I did also edit the photos and short video on the home-page, using Photoshop for the images, and Premiere Pro for the banner-video. </p>
